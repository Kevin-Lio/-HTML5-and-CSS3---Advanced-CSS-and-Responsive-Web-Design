# FSD-HTML5-and-CSS3---Advanced-CSS-and-Responsive-Web-Design
About advanced CSS features such as positioning elements, working with transitions, animations and implementing responsive web design elements using media queries, CSS grid and Flexbox to ensure your website works on all kinds of devices.

CSS Positioning 
In this practice session, you are going to learn about positioning in CSS using the position property. You will create a sticky notes layout where each note is placed randomly on the page and overlaps another.

CSS Sticky Positioning
In this exercise, you'll get to see the outcome of setting the position to 'sticky'. This allows us to quickly build navigation sections that stick at a fixed position on the screen rather than be part of the page's layout.

CSS Pseudo-elements
In this practice session, we are going to learn about targeting and styling the before and after pseudo-elements. 

CSS Variables
CSS Variables are a really incredible way to create reusable property values. You can define properties and values in one place and use them just like variables in computer languages like JavaScript. Variables promote reusability which is why a value can be set in one place and used repeatedly across rulesets. You can either declare variables in a parent element's ruleset and can then access it in all child selectors or you can use the :root pseudo-class and access it anywhere in your stylesheet. In this exercise, you'll follow the latter and use the :root pseudo-class.

Custom Fonts in CSS
In this exercise, you'll use a custom TrueType font in CSS. If you see the contents of the page at the moment, you'll notice the h2 and p elements are using the browser's default font because an explicit font-family has not been defined in the stylesheet.
Included in this exercise, in the src/fonts folder, is a font named Oswald-Regular. This TrueType font can be used to style text on the webpage.

CSS Transitions
CSS allows you to implement transitional animations that can work over multiple properties. In this exercise, you'll style the three buttons that you see on the page. The objective is to implement a subtle animation effect when the user hovers the mouse pointer over a button. This naturally calls for the use of the :hover selector.

Media Queries
In this practice session, we are going to learn how to media queries to define rules based on screen sizes and media type.

CSS Flexbox Properties
In this practice session, we are going to learn how to use CSS flexbox to create a responsive layout. You will learn to use the flex and order properties.

CSS Grid 
In this practice session, we are going to learn how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. You will learn to use CSS properties like grid-template-column, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap. 

CSS Grid Properties
In this practice session, we are going to learn how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. You will learn to use CSS properties like grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start and grid-row-end. 

Grid Areas in CSS Grid
